This folder will contain my learning process in improving my skills in general CTF.

Challenges in this folder will be from past CTFs, with references to relevant writeups that I referred from.

However, I will only refer to the rough idea and thought process of the solution, and implement my own exploit to ensure that I understand the idea thoroughly.

Hopefully with this, I will be able to start cracking new challenges.
