# Introduction

After getting whacked left right and centre by the recent CTFs I entered, I realised that I should build my skills from the ground up.
At least, I would have some idea where to begin. 

Hopefully, I can start udnerstanding some libraries/ build my own tools to optimise my workflow.
So, in these "baby" challenges, I'm probably not always looking for the simplest solution, but one that I can generalise into other tougher problems.
