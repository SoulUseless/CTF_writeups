# Introduction
This is actually my second CTF, but my first write up since I mostly did OSINT challenges during my previous CTF that did not require much documentation (or I did not really document enough).

### The CTF Itself
DSO-NUS CTF 2021 is a cybersecurity Capture-The-Flag challenge open to all students from local tertiary institutions, jointly organised by DSO National Laboratories and NUS Computing.
