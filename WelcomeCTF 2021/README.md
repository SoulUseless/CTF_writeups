# Introduction
This was an entry level CTF by NUS Greyhats over the weekend (13-Aug to 15 Aug).
It has been a while since I last participate in a CTF, with me juggling both internships and other matters.

So I took the chance to brush up on what I knew previously, as well as take the chance to learn some techniques such as BOF and ROP chaining.
